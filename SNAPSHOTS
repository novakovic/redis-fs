Redisfs Snapshots
-----------------

In brief the way that redisfs works is by storing all files, their
contents, and the appropriate meta-data in a series of Redis keys.

Each of these keys has a prefix, which allows for a number of
different filesystems to be mounted against a single (& potentially
remote) redis-server.

The prefix, by default, is "skx:", but this may be changed via the
--prefix argument to redisfs.

Once you've populated a filesystem the redis-server will have keys
with names such as:

  skx:INODE:1:MTIME
  skx:INODE:3:MTIME
  skx:INODE:1:TYPE
  skx:INODE:3:NAME
  skx:INODE:3:MODE
  skx:INODE:1:GID
  skx:INODE:2:GID

To create a snapshot we merely copy all keys which have the "skx:" prefix
to another name:

  snapshot:INODE:1:MTIME
  snapshot:INODE:3:MTIME
  snapshot:INODE:1:TYPE
  ..

This can then be mounted, using the prefix explicitly:

   redisfs --prefix=snapshot:
